# Sample Android Multi-Module Reading List Project

A project with more than one gradle module is known as a multi-module project.

In a constantly growing code base, scalability, readability and code quality usually decrease over time and become difficult to maintain.

Modularisation helps to increase the scalability of your codebase and make it easier to maintain.

Modules should not have knowledge about the inner workings of other modules.

## Advantages:

* Faster compilation,
* Simpler and easier software: 
* Testing new technologies
* Scalability
* Reusability
* Encapsulation

For more information, you can refer to [Guide to Android App Modularisation](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization).
